## Building

Run mvn package. The output will be created at target/ColumnarAwareDedup. This includes jars, deps and scripts.

## Testing

1. Build.
2. Go to target/ColumnarAwareDedup/testmain/scripts.
3. Execute runTestMain.sh 

You should see two log lines. If thats fine, then your setup is correct.
